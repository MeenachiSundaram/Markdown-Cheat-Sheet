# Italics and Bold with Markdown

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore or asterisk ( _ or * ).

* For example, `_this_` or `*this*` word would become italic.

  `_Italics_` = _Italics_

  or

  `*Italics*` = *Italics*

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks or two underscores ( ** or __ ).
* For example, `**this**` or `__this__` word would become bold.

  `__Bold__` = __Bold__

  or

  `**Bold**` = **Bold**

Of course, you can use the following options too `both italics and bold on same line` or `together`.
* For example,

  `Both _Italics_ and **Bold**` = Both _Italics_ and **Bold**

  `**_Together_**` = **_Together_**

Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible

In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores.
