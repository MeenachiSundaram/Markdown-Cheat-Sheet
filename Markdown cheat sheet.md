># Italics and Bold

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore or asterisk ( _ or * ).

* For example, `_this_` or `*this*` word would become italic.

 1. `_italics_` = _italics_

    or

 2. `*italics*` = *italics*


Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks or two underscores ( ** or __ ).
* For example, `**this**` or `__this__` word would become italic.
