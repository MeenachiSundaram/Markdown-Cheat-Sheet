# Italics and Bold with Markdown

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore or asterisk ( _ or * ).

* For example, `_this_` or `*this*` word would become italic.

  `_Italics_` = _Italics_

  or

  `*Italics*` = *Italics*

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks or two underscores ( ** or __ ).
* For example, `**this**` or `__this__` word would become bold.

  `__Bold__` = __Bold__

  or

  `**Bold**` = **Bold**

Of course, you can use the following options too `both italics and bold on same line` or `together`.
* For example,

  `Both _Italics_ and **Bold**` = Both _Italics_ and **Bold**

  `**_Together_**` = **_Together_**

Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible

In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores.

# Headers

This can be used as a titles or subtitles.

There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:

# This is header one
## This is header two
### This is header three
#### This is header four
##### This is header five
###### This is header six

To do so we just add one hash mark for `(# Header One)`, while for a header two, you'd use two `(## Header Two)` and so on.

You can also combine headers with italics and bold as shown below.

### **Bold** <= `### **Bold**`

##### _Italics_ <= `##### _Italics_`
