># Italics and Bold in Markdown

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore or asterisk ( _ or * ).

* For example, `_this_` or `*this*` word would become italic.

  `_Italics_` = _Italics_

  or

  `*Italics*` = *Italics*


Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks or two underscores ( ** or __ ).
* For example, `**this**` or `__this__` word would become bold.

  `__Bold__` = __Bold__

  or

  `**Bold**` = **Bold**
